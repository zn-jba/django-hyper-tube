<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>You and your friends love showing each other funny videos. At some point, you all agreed that sending video files to each other is not very convenient. So, you decide to create a video service where you and your friends can download and view each other videos! This seems like a whole project, but step by step, it's absolutely doable! First, let's start by creating database models.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Throughout the project, we will need at least three models: <code class="java">Tag</code>, <code class="java">Video</code>, and <code class="java">VideoTag</code>.</p>

<p>The model <code class="java">Tag</code> should contain a string field <code class="java">name</code> with a length of 255 characters. The model <code class="java">Video</code> should contain a string <code class="java">title</code> field with a length of 255 characters and a <code class="java">file</code> field. <code class="java">VideoTag</code> should contain two foreign key fields, <code class="java">tag</code> and <code class="java">video</code>, for <code class="java">Tag</code> and <code class="java">Video</code> models, respectively.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary"> Use the default settings of the project with the predefined <em>SQLite</em> database. </div></p>

<p>Define <code class="java">Tag</code>, <code class="java">Video</code>, and <code class="java">VideoTag</code> in the module <em>models.py</em> and migrate them to the database. We check your work this time, so that in the coming stages you are confident enough to add new models by yourself.</p>
