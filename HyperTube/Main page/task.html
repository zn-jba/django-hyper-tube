<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Now we are ready to give the video hosting a face, that is, a nice main page. This page will contain the name of your wonderful hosting, links to the uploaded videos, and some other basic things.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>The main goal of this stage is to create the main page that contains the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>An h2 header tag with the text <code class="java">Hypertube</code>;</li>
	<li>A link to the login page <em>target="_blank" href="/login/";</em></li>
	<li>The number of videos in the<em> p</em> tag;</li>
	<li>Links to the uploaded videos with titles;</li>
	<li>A link to the upload page <em>target="_blank" href="/tube/upload/"</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you start the application on your computer with the command <code class="java">python manage.py runserver</code>, the main page should be available at the address <em>localhost:8000/tube/</em>.</p>
