<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>It all started as a hosting for a bunch of friends, but now it is getting popular. It is time to help the users interact with the server closer with the help of user authentication. In the future, this functionality will also help you grant the registered users more rights.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>The service needs two pages in order to authenticate users: signup and login. On the signup page, users register their accounts, and on the login page, they pass the authentication by their username and password.</p>

<p>You can use <code class="java">django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm</code> for your signup handler. For the login handler, use <code class="java">django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm</code> or <code class="java">django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView</code>.</p>

<p>If the login request is successful, redirect the user to the previous page.</p>

<p>If you start the application on your computer with the command <code class="java">python manage.py runserver</code>, the signup page should be available at the address <em>localhost:8000/signup/. </em>The login page should be at <em>localhost:8000/login/</em>.</p>
